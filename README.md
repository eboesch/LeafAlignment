# Deep Learning for Leaf Image Alignment and Disease Progression Tracking in Field Crops

This thesis will investigate deep learning methods for the alignment and temporal analysis of sequences of wheat leaf images to track disease progression. The goal is to develop an end-to-end framework that reduces manual effort while improving throughput, robustness and precision of disease tracking based on the image sequences, ideally allowing for easy application in the field.

Strategies for exploiting the temporal context to improve consistency in symptom detection and segmentation across image sequences, as well as approaches for a joint optimization of alignment, detection and tracking will be explored.

The results are expected to contribute to unlocking the temporal dimension of crop diseases, which is critical towards understanding resistance mechanisms and improving predictions and management of seasonal epidemics.
